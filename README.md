# Associations of educational level with ECG-derived cardiovascular aging in a population-based cohort: A mediation analysis from the Tromsø Study

This repository contains all R code, data processing scripts, and analysis documents for the first paper of my PhD program.

## Project Overview

We investigate how socioeconomic position—indexed by self-reported education level—relates to accelerated cardiovascular aging, measured by an AI-derived ECG biomarker (δ-age). Using 4,367 participants from Tromsø6 (2007–2008) and Tromsø7 (2015–2016), we:

1. Estimate the association between education and δ-age via linear regression.  
2. Quantify how much of this association is mediated by established CVD risk factors (BMI, blood pressure, cholesterol, diabetes, physical activity, smoking, and antihypertensive medication) using natural effect models (`medflex` package).  
3. Perform sex-specific analyses and sensitivity checks with complete-case data.
